"""
For my DSHI project, I worked with the Wholesale Customers Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. 
The dataset contains annual spending data for customers across several product categories such as Fresh, Milk, Grocery, Frozen, Detergents, and Delicatessen. 
The project started with exploratory data analysis (EDA). After that, I used clustering techniques to group customers with similar purchasing behaviours and used classification methods to predict which customers were likely to be big spenders on the chosen product category. 
The code created in the project can be used by suppliers to plan their inventory and create targeted marketing campaigns. In the Dashboard page the supplier can choose product categories, see spending data, and view a chart of the total spending.
